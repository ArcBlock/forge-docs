### 1. Login in swap service with ABT wallet

After successful login, a native ABT account will be generated in the ABT wallet, and this account card will always be the first of all cards

> **Please check the above steps at this step to ensure that the account on the chain has been successfully registered before proceeding to the next step, otherwise please contact our staff**

### 2. Open the `Ethereum->ArcBlock`Â page

> What is the swap address? The swap address is an ETH account randomly generated by you based on your current asset chain DID account. This account is associated with your asset chain DID account one by one

### 3. Inspect deposit address

Users only need to swap ERC20 ABT to this swap address, and can use any three-party wallet that supports ERC20 swap to complete this operation.

> **In order to ensure the safe and accurate swap of your assets, you can swap a small amount of ERC20 ABT for testing and confirm that it is correct before swapping a larger amount.**

### 4. Track the swap status in swap history
