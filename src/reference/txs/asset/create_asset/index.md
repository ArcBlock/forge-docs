**`CreateAssetTx`** is used to create a new asset on the chain. An asset can contain whatever data you put inside the `data` field: merchandise, goods, certificate, string...

After **`CreateAssetTx`** is executed, an asset is created with a unique addree and the owner is the account that sent the **`CreateAssetTx`** .
The asset could be transferred/exchanged to/with others. The use cases for asset are pretty rich, e.g.:

## Sample Code

```protobuf
message CreateAssetTx {
  string moniker = 1;
  google.protobuf.Any data = 2;
  bool readonly = 3;
  bool transferrable = 4;
  uint32 ttl = 5;
  string parent = 6;
  string address = 7;
}
```

| Name | Data Type | Description |Required|
| - | - | - | - |
|moniker|string|The nick name for the asset|
|readonly|bool|Whether or not the asset is modifiable. By default it's `False`: an asset could be modified later by using update_asset, |
|transferrable|bool|whether or not the asset can be transferred to others. By default it is `True`:  the asset can be transferred.|
|ttl| int|Time To Live(ttl) means how long the asset is availiable after first consumption. By default it is `0`, which is unlimited usage. This is used when an asset is something like a park ticket, it could be valid for 24 hours after first use, or if it is an annual park permit, it could be valid for 365 days.|
|parent|string|Parent asset for this asset. For example, an event is an asset, and all the tickets generated by this event will set its parent to the event address.|
|address|string|pre-computed asset address. This field is required, however Forge SDK will help to calculate the address.| Yes|
| `data` (optional)| [Google.Protobuf.Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any) | Custom user data | Yes|

::: tip
The most important field for an asset is its data - it could be anything that encoded into a `google.protobuf.Any`. Application can define and explain what's inside data, for example, if the asset is a movie ticket, application could define a Ticket message:
:::

```proto
message Ticket {
  string row = 1;
  string seat = 2;
  string room = 3;
  string time = 4;
  string name = 5;
}
```

## Sample Usage

```elixir
> wallet = ForgeSdk.create_wallet()
> ForgeSdk.declare(ForgeAbi.DeclareTx.new(moniker: "sisyphus"), wallet: wallet)
> ticket = "ticket_12345"
> itx = ForgeAbi.CreateAssetTx.new(data: Google.Protobuf.Any.new(type_url: "fg:x:string", data: ticket), readonly: true, transferrable: true, ttl: 7200)
> ForgeSdk.create_asset(itx, wallet: wallet)
```

## Calculating asset address

If unfortunately your language has no SDK support, you need to calculate the address yourself. Below is the algorithm and elixir code to build asset address:

- encode filled the CreateAssetTx itx to binary
- do sha3 to it
- use hash_to_did / pkhash_to_did to generate the did (type shall be asset)

```elixir
hash = Mcrypto.hash(%Mcrypto.Hasher.Sha3{}, ForgeAbi.CreateAssetTx.encode(itx))
AbtDid.hash_to_did(:asset, hash, form: :short)
```
