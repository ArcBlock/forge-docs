Currently the choices are:

* https://bromine.abtnetwork.io/api

Note bromine runs with a nightly build so we can't guarantee it is always online.

Once you have provided the url, click "OK", your local data will be wiped out and after forge restart, your node will start syncing with remote node.

### Reset chain state

From application menu, select "Reset Chain State", then follow instructions to complete.

Once you click "Proceed", you will lose all existing data. You can then click "Quit" and start ABT Chain Node again to have a completely refresh node. If you didn't quit, the chain will follow the current configuration.

::: warning

Please be aware that joining a new network / reset chain state means your local data will be wiped out. If you'd like to preserve your data, please back it up and restore it later. All the data generated by ABT chain node is stored in `~/.forge_desktop`.
