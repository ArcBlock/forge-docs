Currently Forge is supported in osx, centos and ubuntu natively. For other platforms, you can run forge under docker.
If you are using aws cloud or azure, please check the marketplace to find abt chain node. It has everything baked in so that you can spawn your node by a few clicks! We will add more and more cloud provider in future.
